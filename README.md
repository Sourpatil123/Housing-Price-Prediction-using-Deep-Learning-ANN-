# Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning-ANN

🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Deep Learning (ANN)
📘 Overview

This project is my first Deep Learning implementation after working with Machine Learning models.
It focuses on predicting housing prices using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

The objective is to learn how deep learning models handle regression problems, feature scaling, overfitting control, and model evaluation.
